# CS-4265-Big-Data-Analytics
This project focuses on Formula 1 analytics with an emphasis on telemetry, timing, and race event data. Modern Formula 1 races generate large volumes of structured and semi-structured data, including lap times, sector splits, pit stop events, tire strategies, and race conditions across multiple sessions and seasons. As historical data accumulates and race-level granularity increases, analyzing this data on a single machine becomes inefficient due to storage constraints and processing latency. 

This project addresses the challenge of storing, processing, and querying large-scale Formula 1 race data using a distributed big data stack. The system is designed to answer analytical questions such as lap time trends across stints, pit stop performance comparisons, and performance variation across circuits and seasons.

The scope of this project is limited to batch-oriented distribution analytics rather than real-time race prediction. The implementation will ingest historical race and telemetry data, perform distributed processing and aggregation, and support analytical queries. Machine learning-based prediction, live streaming ingestion, and proprietary Formula 1 data sources are outside the scop of this project.
